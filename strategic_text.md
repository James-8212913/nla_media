# Business Understanding

## Business Objectives

The objectives for the research were to better understand how language influences strategic messaging. [This paper](https://www.defence.gov.au/ADC/Publications/AJDSS/documents/volume2-Number1/Hatherell.pdf) in the Australian Journal of Defence and Strategic Studies. Key terms and concepts include the difference between information and ideation and the ethical use of ideational power. These ideas are the root can be considered to assist and influence the Informational element of national power (DIME).

### Information and Ideation

Information can be thought of as observable facts around us.[^a255]

Ideation is considered to be how a collection of minds process and unpack the information and process it - ultimately an opinion will be formed.[^6d34]

Consider information to be facts where as ideation is the way the facts are processed by a population.

> How does information shape the ideas present in societies??

To understand this aspect there are several parts to it

- What sources of information are there for a society:

  - Media outlets
  - Social media
  - Public policy

- What sources of information influence government policy:

  - Media cycles
  - Thinktanks
  - Public Pressure - poll results on certain matters

- What formats does this information come in:

  - Digital
  - Print
  - Radio
  - Television

**Problem** - How to measure changes in the information that has influenced society over time if the information sources have changed in both source and format.

- Consider finding a stable format and source to compare over time for changing messages.
- Need to offer an opinion on how the media (information) landscape has changed over time.

  - How has this influenced the different generations and what effects do they have on the political aspects of ideation and message creation - what percentage of the population are the different demographics and how do they vote?

### Ideational Power

Ideas are the link between the information and how humans process it to form opinions. Neither ideas nor information in isolation are effective as ideas that are supported with information. // Consider how information can be used to create the _facts_ support an idea - what shapes what// which one comes first the idea or the information?

> Grasping the role of ideas in strategic affairs means considering the ability to shape ideas as a form of power in itself.[^2e85]
