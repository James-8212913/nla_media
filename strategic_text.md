# Business Understanding

## Business Objectives

The objectives for the research were to better understand how language influences strategic messaging. [This paper](https://www.defence.gov.au/ADC/Publications/AJDSS/documents/volume2-Number1/Hatherell.pdf) in the Australian Journal of Defence and Strategic Studies. Key terms and concepts include the difference between information and ideation and the ethical use of ideational power. These concepts are at the root of national power and can be considered to assist and influence the Informational element of national power.

### Information and Ideation

Information can be thought of as observable facts around us. [^a255]

Ideation is considered to be how a collection of minds process and unpack the information and process it - ultimately an opinion will be formed. [^6d34]

Consider information to be facts where as ideation is the way the facts are processed by a population.

> How does information shape the ideas present in societies??

To understand this aspect there are several parts to it

- What sources of information are there for a society:

  - Media outlets
  - Social media
  - Public policy

- What sources of information influence government policy:

  - Media (cycles)
  - Think-tanks
  - Public Pressure - poll results on certain matters

- What formats does this information come in:

  - Digital
  - Print
  - Radio
  - Television

**Problem** - How to measure changes in the information that has influenced society over time if the information sources have changed in both source and format.

- Consider finding a stable format and source to compare over time for changing messages.
- Need to offer an opinion on how the media (information) landscape has changed over time.

  - How has this influenced the different generations and what effects do they have on the political aspects of ideation and message creation - what percentage of the population are the different demographics and how do they vote?

The way people and society form opinions is seldom in isolation, information in conjunction with values; cultural beliefs, social identity and emotions also play a part in ideation.[^9ddf] Ideas and information underpin human decision making. Humans are _story telling animals_ rather than rational actors - hence the power of a national strategic _story_ rather than national strategic facts. There is a thought that the best stories are underpinned by facts (information).

### Ideational Power

Ideas are the link between the information and how humans process it to form opinions. Importantly, ideas can change the way information is viewed if well presented - facts can become less factual. Neither ideas nor information in isolation are as effective as ideas that are supported with information.

The concept of ideational scholarship has put power front and centre.[^851e] ideational power as the capacity of actors (whether individual or collective) to influence other actors' normative and cognitive beliefs through the use of ideational elements. [^0bb2]

While information flows and technical systems are the main tools of informational power, identity, values, emotion, beliefs, culture, shared history and perceived interests are the tools of ideational power.[^5167]

Consider how information can be used to create the _facts_ or support an idea. Is there a 'best order'(ideas then information or information then ideas?).

> Grasping the role of ideas in strategic affairs means considering the ability to shape ideas as a form of power in itself.[^bcaa][^9ddf]

### Ethical and Strategic use of Ideational Power

Context is key - the framework and situation in which a certain form of attempted control through ideational power is critical. This is true of all ethical considerations. Ideas can outlive information (facts).[^e097] Crisis situations can be a fertile ground for changing of ideas that may have been long held.

**Problem** How to frame the context when conducting text analysis over strategic_messaging

An organisation or a person attempting to benefit from any form of ideational power must be aware of how they are perceived. To be truely successful purveyors of ideational power must be considered consistent and authentic.[^a793]

Ideational Power is also reliant on how well the idea _resonates_. While the concepts of sound strategic intent are based in facts - military and economic elements of national power can be considered scientific in nature. Ideation may not be backed with the facts. The risk is that the idea isn't supported with information - ideas work until such time as they are compelled to be turned into action. The strategy based on ideation must be cached in facts - not only must it resonate but it must be real.

The _viraliaty_ of the of the ideas is the final element of Ideational Power. How quickly is the idea absorbed across the population.

The gold standard of this is the case for embedding ideas at the institutional level across the various strata of governments. An idea that is consistent in its application from an authentic organisation full of reputable people that not only resonates but is easily transmissible is hard to shake, especially if it is at odds with what your group considers to be true/ real. This kind of influence is the heart strategic messaging. The cognitive leap following this kind of ideation has the opportunity to force society to consider the consequences of the message.

# Data Understanding

Below are some considerations for the collection of the Data and what may be possible. Key considerations will be the ability to identify changes over time while comparing these changes with different documents (think tanks/ policy documents/ media outlets)

## Collection of Data

The plan is to gather various sources of text Data across as many sources as possible to then make comparisons with the various sources against key policy documents. The key challenge identified is the slow cycles (changes) of policy relative to the fast cycles associated with the media. The think-tanks are considered to present an opportunity to bridge this gap somewhat.

### Media outlets

Initial investigations into media outlets has resulted in very few positive outcomes. Large Data holders for the majority of mainstream media tend to have common issues - the free resources don't go very far back (6 wks) or if they do provide the service it is prohibitively expensive (Factiva charge $20 000 per project for access to the media database).

Status - no further engagement will be made seeking media outlet Data due to cost.

### Think Tanks

The majority of Australian Think tanks have excellent web sites (Lowy, Diplomat, ASPI); however, the terms and conditions for the use of the website generally prohibit collecting Data from them. [The Lowy Institute](https://www.lowyinstitute.org) however has no such restrictions. [Australian Strategic Policy Institute](https://www.aspi.org.au) restrict the scraping of Data from the website; however, following email engagement they are comfortable to share 640 special reports for analysis - this is a significant source of Data. [The Diplomat](https://thediplomat.com) are a paid periodical.

It should be noted that some of the think tanks have changed publication methods which has influenced frequency, size and format of published articles.

Status - more than 8000 entries gathered dating back to 2004 from the Lowy institute with continued collection ongoing. ASPI is still coming back with anticipated positive results by the end of the week with access to all _special reports_ (640 total approximately 40 pages long each).

### Social media

Social media suffers the same fate as media outlets, the history doesn't exist when trying to make meaningful comparisons over time - the time frames when considering policy changes are significant and social media platforms only allow approximately 6 weeks of history to be collected. There is an opportunity to provide a demonstration of what is possible with respect to Social Network Analysis and language trends by following key government officials.

Status - No further action will be taken at this time pending the desire to compare this short feed with the longer term feed of think tank work.

### Policy Documents

The policy documents are all open source and readily available. The focus will be initially Defence White papers and the associated Integrated investment plans and strategic updates. If there is a strong trend in initial analysis that indicated economic discussions then budgets and policy documents may be collected to enable a comparison against the public discourse.

Status - Not yet gathered but anticipated to be completed prior to Exploration of the Data occurring.

### Historical Records

The National Library of Australia (NLA) has been engaged and they offer a service called [Trove](https://trove.nla.gov.au). The time periods associated with this are well in excess of what is required but it could be a good source of information if reaching back to 1930 for a comparison leading into World War II - as an inflection point in history around ideation and strategy.

## Description of Data

Text Data will be the only form of Data that will be used. It will be in a variety of formats across several sources. It is anticipated there will be in excess of 10000 specific entries. As a start point the period for investigation will be boxed between 2000 and the present day. The Data will be held on a local computer and also in a central coding repository for remote access. Access to this repository can be made available on request.

## Exploration of Data

Various graphs will go in this section.

## Verify the Quality of the Data

TBC

# Data Preparation

The Data will be cleaned and 'tidied' prior to any modelling.

# Modeling

It is anticipated that topic modelling will be done to identify different topics that may not be readily present on reading. This is a form of unsupervised machine learning and has the ability to provide insights by way of identifying not only the central topics but also the most important terms in specific documents.

# Evaluation

# Deployment

It is not anticipated this will be deployed to a 'live' environment. It is however anticipated that the results will be shared with ASPI and other interested parties from within the Defence community.
